# Judy Darwish — Cyber Security Trainee | Penetration Tester | SOC Enthusiast

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio.  
This repository showcases all my hands‑on work from my cybersecurity training, including penetration testing projects, SOC‑related labs, TryHackMe progress, theoretical and practical tasks, and real application exploitation.

I trained as a **Cyber Security / Penetration Tester** and I am also interested in the **SOC (Blue Team) path**, currently progressing through TryHackMe rooms and completing hands‑on labs.

This page highlights the practical rooms I completed on TryHackMe as part of my cybersecurity training.  
During my internship at a private cyber security training company, I was required to complete specific hands‑on labs on TryHackMe.  
I am continuing to study regularly and progressing through more offensive and SOC‑related rooms.
